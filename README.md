# 🍛 One-Pot Creamy Mushroom Vegan Pasta & Coconut Chickpea Curry Recipe Collection

Welcome to my recipe collection, where I've turned my kitchen chaos into a beautifully organized HTML and CSS feast! 🥘✨

## What’s Cooking?

This project is a delightful combination of **One-Pot Creamy Mushroom Vegan Pasta** and **Coconut Chickpea Curry** recipes, all styled to make your taste buds tingle and your web page sparkle. I embarked on this culinary coding adventure as part of The Odin Project, where I learned the ABCs of HTML and CSS—think `ul`, `li`, `h1`, and a dash of `flexbox` for good measure.

## What’s on the Menu?

- **HTML Basics:** I’ve learned how to serve up headings, lists, and links with style.
- **CSS Styling:** From centering logos to making images hover like they’re at a dance party, I’ve sprinkled some magic on this project.
