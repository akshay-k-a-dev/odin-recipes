            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat the Oil: In a deep pot over medium-high heat, add the coconut oil.</li>
                <li>Add in the Onions and Tomatoes: Grind some sea salt and ground black pepper over the mixture and stir together. Lower heat to medium and allow to cook down until the juices of the tomatoes are naturally released and onions are soft, about 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add in the Chickpeas: Also mix in the garlic, garam masala, curry powder, and cumin. Stir to combine.</li>
                <li>Add in the Coconut Milk and Stir Again: Add in the coconut flour (optional) to slightly thicken the curry. Bring the curry to a boil, then reduce to medium-low to simmer for 10 to 12 more minutes.</li>
                <li>Serve and Enjoy: Taste the curry and season with salt and pepper if needed. Remove from heat, squeeze lime over the curry, stir, and serve. Enjoy!</li>
